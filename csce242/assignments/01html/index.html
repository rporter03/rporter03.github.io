        <h1>My Passion For Music</h1>
        <p>Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved music. My dad would get me to get one of his CDs while he was driving and then we would jam out to whatever he put on. I would also drum on the couch at home with little toy wrenches thinking I was the best drummer ever. However, that would change when my parents gave me a guitar as a Christmas gift. I later took guitar lessons and that began my real journey into the world of music.</p>
        <p>When I got into middle school, I joined the school band and began learning how to play the saxophone. I played sax until I graduated high school and I've made many accomplishments during that time. I was apart of the marching band, jazz band, and the highest level of concert band my school had to offer. Nowadays, I listen to music more than I actually play it, but I enjoy it just as much, if not more. I am always looking for new music to discover, music history to learn about, and people who share the same level of passion I do for this art.</p>
